# Temperature-Monitoring

All pharmacies in South Africa require their medication in the fridges and on the shelves to be maintained within a specific temperature range. Here, I have created a program that monitors the temperatures at multiple locations using probes. The temperatures are then recorded and stored in an Excel workbook for historical analysis. In addition, the client is notified when the temperature measurement of a certain probe exceeds its set range.
